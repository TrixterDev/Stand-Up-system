Stand-Up System
This is the README file for the Stand-Up System project built with Vite.js. The Stand-Up System is a tool to help teams conduct stand-up meetings effectively and keep track of the progress of their daily tasks.

Getting Started
To run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. If you don't have them, you can download and install them from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/
